# Leetcode and Coding Journey

## INTRO:

**Hello,**

My name is **_Emmanuel Rosario_**, an apprentice coder and aspiring software engineer.
<br>
I am an artist who had taught art classes for 2 years and has thought to take a career pivot.
While art is something that I still, do I have reserved it as a hobby.
I have always enjoyed learning and trying out new things.
What better way to do that, than in a career that is challenging me and always making me learn new and exciting ideas.

## What is this?

**_This is my daily coding log!_**
To help me keep track of my process this is where I will document my journey.
I will do challenges and daily codings that will help my further understanding of code, primarily using **JS and Python**.

## Current GOAL:

**Winter 2024:**

Become intimate with the basics...

- Objects{}

Learn Data structures
